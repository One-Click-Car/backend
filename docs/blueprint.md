## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A sophisticated, slightly desaturated blue (#4569A0) evoking professionalism, reliability, and technology.
- Background color: A very light, almost white background with a subtle blue tint (#F3F6F8) for cleanliness and focus on content.
- Accent color: A brighter, more saturated light blue (#4CC5DB) provides a fresh and energetic highlight for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern and tech-inspired feel. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear, neutral, and highly readable text.
- Use clean, modern, and outlined icons that visually represent automotive features, search functionalities, and user interactions to maintain a sleek aesthetic.
- Employ a spacious, grid-based layout with generous whitespace to ensure readability and allow car listings and details to breathe. Prioritize responsive design for seamless viewing across all devices.
- Incorporate subtle micro-interactions such as gentle hover effects on car listings, smooth transitions when filtering results, and subtle loading animations to enhance the user experience without distraction.
